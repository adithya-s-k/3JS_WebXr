## Tomorrow, we'll be working with Three.js !

### What is Three.js?
Three.js is a JavaScript library and used to create and display animated 3D graphics in a web browser. It's really, really powerful - and the best part is, we can get started in a jiffy !

### Some really cool examples of Three.js in action

### Some Important Terms

#### Scene
A scene represents the main 3D environment in the application. This is where you place all your models, lights, and cameras and arrange them together to a coherent experience.

#### Renderer
The renderer is the part responsible for actually drawing our scene on the screen.

#### Camera
The camera represents the usersâ€™ view of the scene. The ones most commonly used are the `PerspectiveCamera` and the `OrthographicCamera`. <br />

#### Light
Without a source of light, the scene will appear like a pitch-black void when rendered to the canvas.

### Models & Meshes
Three.js allows us to both load pre-made 3D models ( made with 3D design software like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Spline](https://spline.design/) ), as well as create 3D objects from the ground up ( with code ! ).
