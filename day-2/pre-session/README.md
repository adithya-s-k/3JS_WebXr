On Day 1, we worked with CodeSandbox - an editor on the cloud that didn't have any installation requirements. <br />
On Day 2, we'll be working locally ! When we're working locally rather than using an inline code editor, we'll need to set up a webserver, which is what Node.js is for.<br />
Otherwise, due to browser security restrictions, you wonâ€™t be able to load external texture files from your hard drive.

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

This article will help you get set up - [Article Link](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/)


### 2. Make sure you have a code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) on your machine


If you've done the above already, you're all set ! See you in class :)
